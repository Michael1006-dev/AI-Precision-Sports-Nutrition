# Source Data and Visualizations

This directory contains the underlying analytical data and raw visual outputs generated during the bibliometric analysis for the study **"AI-Driven Precision Sports Nutrition: From General Guidelines to Algorithmic Decision-Making"**.

These files serve as the source material for the figures and tables presented in the main manuscript.

## 1. Directory Structure
The subfolders are organized according to the specific Figures and Tables they correspond to in the manuscript (e.g., `Figure 1 + Table 3`). 

Inside each subfolder, you may find:
- **Statistical Data**: (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, or `.txt`) The quantitative data extracted from the bibliometric analysis (e.g., annual publication counts, keyword frequency lists, centrality scores).
- **Vector Graphics**: (`.svg`) Scalable vector images directly exported from R/Bibliometrix, suitable for high-resolution editing.
- **Raster Images**: (`.png`, `.jpg`) High-quality preview images of the network maps and charts.

## 2. Note on Formatting
While the data contained herein is identical to that reported in the study, the visual appearance of the figures in the final manuscript may differ slightly from the raw outputs found in this folder. 

Minor aesthetic adjustments (e.g., font size normalization, layout alignment, label positioning) were performed on the raw `.svg` files to enhance readability and meet the journal's publication standards. No underlying data points or statistical relationships were altered during this process.

## 3. Reproduction
These outputs were generated using the scripts provided in the `Software_Code_R` folder found in the parent directory of the Supplementary Materials.
