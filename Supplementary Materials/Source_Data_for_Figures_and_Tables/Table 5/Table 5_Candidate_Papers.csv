CERVENKA I;AGUDELO LZ;RUAS JL,2017,"KYNURENINES: TRYPTOPHAN'S METABOLITES IN EXERCISE, INFLAMMATION, AND MENTAL HEALTH",SCIENCE,1013,126.6,Classic Foundation (High TC),"KYNURENINE METABOLITES ARE GENERATED BY TRYPTOPHAN CATABOLISM AND REGULATE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES THAT INCLUDE HOST-MICROBIOME SIGNALING, IMMUNE CELL RESPONSE, AND NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. ENZYMES OF THE KYNURENINE PATHWAY ARE EXPRESSED IN DIFFERENT TISSUES AND CELL TYPES THROUGHOUT THE BODY AND ARE REGULATED BY CUES, INCLUDING NUTRITIONAL AND INFLAMMATORY SIGNALS. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS SYSTEMIC METABOLIC INTEGRATION, PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ACCUMULATION OF KYNURENINE IN THE BRAIN, WHICH HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DEPRESSION AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. CONVERSELY, KYNURENINE ACCUMULATION CAN BE SUPPRESSED BY ACTIVATING KYNURENINE CLEARANCE IN EXERCISED SKELETAL MUSCLE. THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE TRAINING ON DEPRESSION THROUGH MODULATION OF THE KYNURENINE PATHWAY HIGHLIGHTS AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM OF INTERORGAN CROSS-TALK MEDIATED BY THESE METABOLITES. HERE, WE DISCUSS PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS OF TRYPTOPHAN-KYNURENINE METABOLISM AND THEIR EFFECTS ON INFLAMMATORY, METABOLIC, ONCOLOGIC, AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS."

IN ADDITION TO MERELY CHANGING WELL-KNOWN RISK FACTORS FOR SYSTEMIC CVD, REGULAR EXERCISE CAN ALSO IMPROVE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH THROUGH NON-TRADITIONAL MECHANISMS. UNDERSTANDING THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH EXERCISE INFLUENCES DIFFERENT PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS IS IMPORTANT AND MIGHT YIELD NEW THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO TARGET PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS IN CVD. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES A CRITICAL DISCUSSION OF HOW REGULAR EXERCISE CAN HAVE ANTIATHEROGENIC EFFECTS IN THE VASCULATURE, IMPROVE AUTONOMIC BALANCE (THEREBY REDUCING THE RISK OF MALIGNANT ARRHYTHMIAS), AND INDUCE CARDIOPROTECTION AGAINST ISCHAEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY, INDEPENDENT OF EFFECTS ON TRADITIONAL CVD RISK FACTORS. THIS REVIEW ALSO DESCRIBES HOW EXERCISE PROMOTES A HEALTHY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MILIEU (LARGELY THROUGH THE RELEASE OF MUSCLE-DERIVED MYOKINES), STIMULATES MYOCARDIAL REGENERATION, AND AMELIORATES AGE-RELATED LOSS OF MUSCLE MASS AND STRENGTH, A FREQUENTLY OVERLOOKED NON-TRADITIONAL CVD RISK FACTOR. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS HOW THE BENEFITS OF EXERCISE MIGHT ALSO OCCUR VIA PROMOTION OF A HEALTHY GUT MICROBIOTA. WE ARGUE, THEREFORE, THAT A HOLISTIC VIEW OF ALL BODY SYSTEMS IS NECESSARY AND USEFUL WHEN ANALYSING THE ROLE OF EXERCISE IN CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH."

NONETHELESS, SUPPLEMENT USE IS WIDESPREAD AT ALL LEVELS OF SPORT. PRODUCTS DESCRIBED AS SUPPLEMENTS TARGET DIFFERENT ISSUES, INCLUDING (1) THE MANAGEMENT OF MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES, (2) SUPPLY OF CONVENIENT FORMS OF ENERGY AND MACRONUTRIENTS, AND (3) PROVISION OF DIRECT BENEFITS TO PERFORMANCE OR (4) INDIRECT BENEFITS SUCH AS SUPPORTING INTENSE TRAINING REGIMENS. THE APPROPRIATE USE OF SOME SUPPLEMENTS CAN BENEFIT THE ATHLETE, BUT OTHERS MAY HARM THE ATHLETE'S HEALTH, PERFORMANCE, AND/OR LIVELIHOOD AND REPUTATION (IF AN ANTIDOPING RULE VIOLATION RESULTS). A COMPLETE NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN BEFORE DECISIONS REGARDING SUPPLEMENT USE ARE MADE. SUPPLEMENTS CLAIMING TO DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ENHANCE PERFORMANCE ARE TYPICALLY THE LARGEST GROUP OF PRODUCTS MARKETED TO ATHLETES, BUT ONLY A FEW (INCLUDING CAFFEINE, CREATINE, SPECIFIC BUFFERING AGENTS AND NITRATE) HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE OF BENEFITS. HOWEVER, RESPONSES ARE AFFECTED BY THE SCENARIO OF USE AND MAY VARY WIDELY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF FACTORS THAT INCLUDE GENETICS, THE MICROBIOME AND HABITUAL DIET. SUPPLEMENTS INTENDED TO ENHANCE PERFORMANCE SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY TRIALLED IN TRAINING OR SIMULATED COMPETITION BEFORE BEING USED IN COMPETITION. INADVERTENT INGESTION OF SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED UNDER THE ANTIDOPING CODES THAT GOVERN ELITE SPORT IS A KNOWN RISK OF TAKING SOME SUPPLEMENTS. PROTECTION OF THE ATHLETE'S HEALTH AND AWARENESS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM MUST BE PARAMOUNT; EXPERT PROFESSIONAL OPINION AND ASSISTANCE IS STRONGLY ADVISED BEFORE AN ATHLETE EMBARKS ON SUPPLEMENT USE."

AGEING IS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTOR TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CHRONIC DISORDERS ALL ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE ELDERLY. IN 2019, THE CHINESE POPULATION CONSTITUTED 18 % OF THE WORLD POPULATION, WITH 164.5 MILLION CHINESE CITIZENS AGED 65 AND ABOVE (65+), AND 26 MILLION AGED 80 OR ABOVE (80+). CHINA HAS BECOME AN AGEING SOCIETY, AND AS IT CONTINUES TO AGE IT WILL CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE THE BURDEN BORNE BY CURRENT FAMILY AND PUBLIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. MAJOR HEALTHCARE CHALLENGES INVOLVED WITH CARING FOR THE ELDERLY IN CHINA INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (CNCDS), PHYSICAL FRAILTY, NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, WITH EMERGING CHALLENGES SUCH AS PROVIDING SUFFICIENT DENTAL CARE, COMBATING THE RISING PREVALENCE OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES AMONG NURSING HOME COMMUNITIES, PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR INCREASED INCIDENCES OF IMMUNE DISEASES, AND THE GROWING NECESSITY TO PROVIDE PALLIATIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. AT THE GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL, IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLANS TO RESPOND TO THE PRESSURES OF AN AGEING SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY TO ESTABLISH A NATIONWIDE, AFFORDABLE, ANNUAL HEALTH CHECK SYSTEM TO FACILITATE EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE TREATMENTS. CHINA HAS BEGUN WORK ON SEVERAL ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES INCLUDING THE RECENT COMPLETION OF THE OF THE TEN-YEAR HEALTH-CARE REFORM PROJECT, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTHY CHINA 2030 ACTION PLAN, AND THE OPENING OF THE NATIONAL CLINICAL RESEARCH CENTER FOR GERIATRIC DISORDERS. THERE ARE ALSO SOCIETAL CHALLENGES, NAMELY THE SHIFT FROM AN EXTENDED FAMILY SYSTEM IN WHICH THE YOUNGER PROVIDE HOME CARE FOR THEIR ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS, TO THE CURRENT TREND IN WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY MIGRATING TOWARDS MAJOR CITIES FOR WORK, INCREASING RELIANCE ON NURSING HOMES TO COMPENSATE, ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING THE OUTCOMES OF THE 'ONE CHILD POLICY' AND THE 'EMPTY-NEST ELDERLY' PHENOMENON. AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE AVENUES FOR PEOPLE TO SEEK AND IMPROVE THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE OF HEALTH AND DISEASE, TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO SEEK MEDICAL CHECK-UPS TO PREVENT/MANAGE ILLNESS, AND TO FIND WAYS TO PROMOTE MODIFIABLE HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS (SOCIAL ACTIVITY, EXERCISE, HEALTHY DIETS, REASONABLE DIET SUPPLEMENTS) TO ENABLE HEALTHIER, HAPPIER, LONGER, AND MORE PRODUCTIVE LIVES IN THE ELDERLY. FINALLY, AT THE TECHNOLOGICAL OR TREATMENT LEVEL, THERE IS A FOCUS ON MODERN TECHNOLOGIES TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF AGEING. RESEARCHERS ARE STRIVING TO PRODUCE DRUGS THAT CAN MIMIC THE EFFECTS OF 'EXERCISING MORE, EATING LESS', WHILE OTHER ANTI-AGEING MOLECULES FROM MOLECULAR GERONTOLOGISTS COULD HELP TO IMPROVE 'HEALTHSPAN' IN THE ELDERLY. MACHINE LEARNING, 'BIG DATA', AND OTHER NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES CAN ALSO BE USED TO MONITOR DISEASE PATTERNS AT THE POPULATION LEVEL AND MAY BE USED TO INFORM POLICY DESIGN IN THE FUTURE. COLLECTIVELY, SYNERGIES ACROSS DISCIPLINES ON POLICIES, GERIATRIC CARE, DRUG DEVELOPMENT, PERSONAL AWARENESS, THE USE OF BIG DATA, MACHINE LEARNING AND PERSONALIZED MEDICINE WILL TRANSFORM CHINA INTO A COUNTRY THAT ENABLES THE MOST FOR ITS ELDERLY, MAXIMIZING AND CELEBRATING THEIR LONGEVITY IN THE COMING DECADES. THIS IS THE 2ND EDITION OF THE REVIEW PAPER (FANG EF ET AL., AGEING RE. REV. 2015)."

WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT EXTREME PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH ASSOCIATED DIETARY ADAPTATIONS, SUCH AS THAT PURSUED BY PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES, IS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN FAECAL MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION RELATIVE TO THAT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A MORE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. HERE WE ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON THE FUNCTIONALITY/METABOLIC ACTIVITY OF THE MICROBIOTA WHICH REVEALS EVEN GREATER SEPARATION BETWEEN EXERCISE AND A MORE SEDENTARY STATE. DESIGN METABOLIC PHENOTYPING AND FUNCTIONAL METAGENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE GUT MICROBIOME OF PROFESSIONAL INTERNATIONAL RUGBY UNION PLAYERS (N=40) AND CONTROLS (N=46) WAS CARRIED OUT AND RESULTS WERE CORRELATED WITH LIFESTYLE PARAMETERS AND CLINICAL MEASUREMENTS (EG, DIETARY HABIT AND SERUM CREATINE KINASE, RESPECTIVELY). RESULTS ATHLETES HAD RELATIVE INCREASES IN PATHWAYS (EG, AMINO ACID AND ANTIBIOTIC BIOSYNTHESIS AND CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM) AND FAECAL METABOLITES (EG, MICROBIAL PRODUCED SHORT-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (SCFAS) ACETATE, PROPIONATE AND BUTYRATE) ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED MUSCLE TURNOVER (FITNESS) AND OVERALL HEALTH WHEN COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENCES IN FAECAL MICROBIOTA BETWEEN ATHLETES AND SEDENTARY CONTROLS SHOW EVEN GREATER SEPARATION AT THE METAGENOMIC AND METABOLOMIC THAN AT COMPOSITIONAL LEVELS AND PROVIDE ADDED INSIGHT INTO THE DIET-EXERCISE-GUT MICROBIOTA PARADIGM."

THE PRESENT REVIEW AIMS TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT OF THE WESTERN PATTERN DIET ON THE METABOLISM, INFLAMMATION, AND ANTIOXIDANT STATUS; THE IMPACT ON GUT MICROBIOTA AND MITOCHONDRIAL FITNESS; THE EFFECT OF ON CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH, AND CANCER; AND THE SANITARY COST OF THE WESTERN DIET. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, A CONSENSUS CRITICAL REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING PRIMARY SOURCES, SUCH AS SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES, AND SECONDARY SOURCES, INCLUDING BIBLIOGRAPHIC INDEXES, DATABASES, AND WEB PAGES. SCOPUS, EMBASE, SCIENCE DIRECT, SPORTS DISCUSS, RESEARCHGATE, AND THE WEB OF SCIENCE WERE USED TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT. MESH-COMPLIANT KEYWORDS SUCH ""WESTERN DIET"", ""INFLAMMATION"", ""METABOLIC HEALTH"", ""METABOLIC FITNESS"", ""HEART DISEASE"", ""CANCER"", ""OXIDATIVE STRESS"", ""MENTAL HEALTH"", AND ""METABOLISM"" WERE USED.

OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE AND REPORT MEASUREMENT ACCURACY FOR FITBIT ACTIVITY TRACKERS IN CONTROLLED AND FREE-LIVING SETTINGS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED ELECTRONIC SEARCHES USING PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, AND SPORTDISCUS DATABASES WITH A SUPPLEMENTARY GOOGLE SCHOLAR SEARCH. WE CONSIDERED ORIGINAL RESEARCH PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH COMPARING FITBIT VERSUS A REFERENCE-OR RESEARCH-STANDARD CRITERION IN HEALTHY ADULTS AND THOSE LIVING WITH ANY HEALTH CONDITION OR DISABILITY. WE ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS USING A MODIFICATION OF THE CONSENSUS-BASED STANDARDS FOR THE SELECTION OF HEALTH STATUS MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS. WE EXPLORED MEASUREMENT ACCURACY FOR STEPS, ENERGY EXPENDITURE, SLEEP, TIME IN ACTIVITY, AND DISTANCE USING GROUP PERCENTAGE DIFFERENCES AS THE COMMON RUBRIC FOR ERROR COMPARISONS. WE CONDUCTED DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES FOR FREQUENCY OF ACCURACY COMPARISONS WITHIN A +/- 3% ERROR IN CONTROLLED AND +/- 10% ERROR IN FREE-LIVING SETTINGS AND ASSESSED FOR POTENTIAL BIAS OF OVER-OR UNDERESTIMATION. WE SECONDARILY EXPLORED HOW VARIATIONS IN BODY PLACEMENT, AMBULATION SPEED, OR TYPE OF ACTIVITY INFLUENCED ACCURACY. RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 67 STUDIES. CONSISTENT EVIDENCE INDICATED THAT FITBIT DEVICES WERE LIKELY TO MEET ACCEPTABLE ACCURACY FOR STEP COUNT APPROXIMATELY HALF THE TIME, WITH A TENDENCY TO UNDERESTIMATE STEPS IN CONTROLLED TESTING AND OVERESTIMATE STEPS IN FREE-LIVING SETTINGS. FINDINGS ALSO SUGGESTED A GREATER TENDENCY TO PROVIDE ACCURATE MEASURES FOR STEPS DURING NORMAL OR SELF-PACED WALKING WITH TORSO PLACEMENT, DURING JOGGING WITH WRIST PLACEMENT, AND DURING SLOW OR VERY SLOW WALKING WITH ANKLE PLACEMENT IN ADULTS WITH NO MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. CONSISTENT EVIDENCE INDICATED THAT FITBIT DEVICES WERE UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE ACCURATE MEASURES FOR ENERGY EXPENDITURE IN ANY TESTING CONDITION. EVIDENCE FROM A FEW STUDIES ALSO SUGGESTED THAT, COMPARED WITH RESEARCH-GRADE ACCELEROMETERS, FITBIT DEVICES MAY PROVIDE SIMILAR MEASURES FOR TIME IN BED AND TIME SLEEPING, WHILE LIKELY MARKEDLY OVERESTIMATING TIME SPENT IN HIGHER-INTENSITY ACTIVITIES AND UNDERESTIMATING DISTANCE DURING FASTER-PACED AMBULATION. HOWEVER, FURTHER ACCURACY STUDIES ARE WARRANTED. OUR POINT ESTIMATIONS FOR MEAN OR MEDIAN PERCENTAGE ERROR GAVE EQUAL WEIGHTING TO ALL ACCURACY COMPARISONS, POSSIBLY MISREPRESENTING THE TRUE POINT ESTIMATE FOR MEASUREMENT BIAS FOR SOME OF THE TESTING CONDITIONS WE EXAMINED. CONCLUSIONS: OTHER THAN FOR MEASURES OF STEPS IN ADULTS WITH NO LIMITATIONS IN MOBILITY, DISCRETION SHOULD BE USED WHEN CONSIDERING THE USE OF FITBIT DEVICES AS AN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL IN RESEARCH OR TO INFORM HEALTH CARE DECISIONS, AS THERE ARE SEEMINGLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WHERE THE DEVICE IS LIKELY TO PROVIDE ACCURATE MEASUREMENT."

ATHLETES HAVE GRAVITATED TOWARD THE USE OF WEARABLE SENSORS TO MONITOR THEIR TRAINING AND RECOVERY. WEARABLE TECHNOLOGIES CURRENTLY UTILIZED BY SPORTS TEAMS MONITOR BOTH THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL WORKLOAD OF ATHLETES. HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS AN UNMET MEDICAL NEED BY THE SPORTS COMMUNITY TO GAIN FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE INTERNAL WORKLOAD OF THE ATHLETE TO TAILOR RECOVERY PROTOCOLS TO EACH ATHLETE. THE ABILITY TO MONITOR BIOMARKERS FROM SALIVA OR SWEAT IN A NONINVASIVE AND CONTINUOUS MANNER REMAIN THE NEXT TECHNOLOGICAL GAP FOR SPORTS MEDICAL PERSONNEL TO TAILOR HYDRATION AND RECOVERY PROTOCOLS PER THE ATHLETE. THE EMERGENCE OF FLEXIBLE AND STRETCHABLE ELECTRONICS COUPLED WITH THE ABILITY TO QUANTIFY BIOCHEMICAL ANALYTES AND PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS HAVE ENABLED THE DETECTION OF KEY MARKERS INDICATIVE OF PERFORMANCE AND STRESS, AS REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER."
BOSCO N;NOTI M,2021,THE AGING GUT MICROBIOME AND ITS IMPACT ON HOST IMMUNITY,GENES AND IMMUNITY,275,68.8,Classic Foundation (High TC),"THE MICROBIOME PLAYS A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN THE MATURATION, FUNCTION, AND REGULATION OF THE HOST-IMMUNE SYSTEM FROM BIRTH TO OLD AGE. IN RETURN, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS CO-EVOLVED A MUTUALISTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH TRILLIONS OF BENEFICIAL MICROBES RESIDING OUR BODIES WHILE MOUNTING EFFICIENT RESPONSES TO FIGHT INVADING PATHOGENS. AS WE AGE, BOTH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND THE GUT MICROBIOME UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN COMPOSITION AND FUNCTION THAT CORRELATE WITH INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND REDUCED VACCINATION RESPONSES. EMERGING STUDIES SUGGEST THAT TARGETING AGE-RELATED DYSBIOSIS CAN IMPROVE HEALTH- AND LIFESPAN, IN PART THROUGH REDUCING SYSTEMIC LOW-GRADE INFLAMMATION AND IMMUNOSENESCENCE-TWO HALLMARKS OF THE AGING PROCESS. HOWEVER-A CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP OF AGE-RELATED DYSBIOSIS AND ASSOCIATED FUNCTIONAL DECLINES IN IMMUNE CELL FUNCTIONING HAVE YET TO BE DEMONSTRATED IN CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO (I) GIVE AN OVERVIEW ON HALLMARKS OF THE AGING IMMUNE SYSTEM AND GUT MICROBIOME, (II) DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF AGE-RELATED CHANGES IN THE GUT COMMENSAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE (INTRODUCED AS MICROB-AGING) ON HOST-IMMUNE FITNESS AND HEALTH, AND (III) SUMMARIZE PREBIOTIC- AND PROBIOTIC CLINICAL INTERVENTION TRIALS AIMING TO REINFORCE AGE-RELATED DECLINES IN IMMUNE CELL FUNCTIONING THROUGH MICROBIOME MODULATION OR REJUVENATION."
VAN HUL M;CANI PD;PETITFILS C;DE VOS WM;TILG H;EL-OMAR EM,2024,WHAT DEFINES A HEALTHY GUT MICROBIOME?,GUT,142,142,Emerging Disruptor (High Velocity),"THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CHANGES IN MICROBIOME COMPOSITION CAN INFLUENCE CHRONIC HUMAN DISEASES AND THE EFFICIENCY OF THERAPIES HAS DRIVEN EFFORTS TO DEVELOP MICROBIOTA-CENTRED THERAPIES SUCH AS FIRST AND NEXT GENERATION PROBIOTICS, PREBIOTICS AND POSTBIOTICS, MICROBIOTA EDITING AND FAECAL MICROBIOTA TRANSPLANTATION. CENTRAL TO MICROBIOME RESEARCH IS UNDERSTANDING HOW DISEASE IMPACTS MICROBIOME COMPOSITION AND VICE VERSA, YET THERE IS A PROBLEMATIC ISSUE WITH THE TERM 'DYSBIOSIS', WHICH BROADLY LINKS MICROBIAL IMBALANCES TO VARIOUS CHRONIC ILLNESSES WITHOUT PRECISION OR DEFINITION. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN MICROBIOME DISCUSSIONS IS DEFINING 'HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS' TO ASCERTAIN WHAT CHARACTERISES A HEALTHY MICROBIOME. THIS INVOLVES QUESTIONING WHO REPRESENTS THE HEALTHIEST SEGMENT OF OUR POPULATION-WHETHER IT IS THOSE FREE FROM ILLNESSES, ATHLETES AT PEAK PERFORMANCE, INDIVIDUALS LIVING HEALTHILY THROUGH REGULAR EXERCISE AND GOOD NUTRITION OR EVEN ELDERLY ADULTS OR CENTENARIANS WHO HAVE BEEN TESTED BY TIME AND ACHIEVED REMARKABLE HEALTHY LONGEVITY. THIS REVIEW ADVOCATES FOR DELINEATING 'WHAT DEFINES A HEALTHY MICROBIOME?' BY CONSIDERING A BROADER RANGE OF FACTORS RELATED TO HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ON THE MICROBIOTA. A HEALTHY MICROBIOME IS UNDOUBTEDLY LINKED TO GUT HEALTH. NEVERTHELESS, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF 'GUT HEALTH' DUE TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF MEASURING GUT FUNCTIONALITY BESIDES THE MICROBIOTA COMPOSITION. WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITIES, THE INFLUENCE OF DIET, LIFESTYLE, HOST AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. MOREOVER, THE CHALLENGE IN DISTINGUISHING CAUSATION FROM CORRELATION BETWEEN GUT MICROBIOME AND OVERALL HEALTH IS PRESENTED. THE REVIEW ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE RESOURCE-HEAVY NATURE OF COMPREHENSIVE GUT HEALTH ASSESSMENTS, WHICH HINDERS THEIR PRACTICALITY AND BROAD APPLICATION. FINALLY, WE CALL FOR CONTINUED RESEARCH AND A NUANCED APPROACH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE INTRICATE AND EVOLVING CONCEPT OF GUT HEALTH, EMPHASISING THE NEED FOR MORE PRECISE AND INCLUSIVE DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGIES IN STUDYING THE MICROBIOME."
COLLINS EJ;BOWYER C;TSOUZA A;CHOPRA M,2022,TOMATOES: AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF THE ASSOCIATED HEALTH IMPACTS OF TOMATOES AND FACTORS THAT CAN AFFECT THEIR CULTIVATION,BIOLOGY-BASEL,171,57,Emerging Disruptor (High Velocity),"SIMPLE SUMMARY THE RESEARCH OUTLINED IN THIS REVIEW PAPER DISCUSSES POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH A DIET ENRICHED WITH TOMATOES AND TOMATO PRODUCTS. THIS INCLUDES DETAILS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE ANTICANCER PROPERTIES OF TOMATOES, PROTECTION AGAINST CARDIOVASCULAR AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES AND DIABETES, MAINTENANCE OF A HEALTHY GUT MICROBIOME, AND IMPROVED SKIN HEALTH, FERTILITY, IMMUNE RESPONSE, AND EXERCISE RECOVERY. THE SPECIFIC PARTS OF A TOMATO FRUIT THAT CONTRIBUTE THESE HEALTH BENEFITS ARE ALSO OUTLINED. THE POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGES TO A TOMATO-RICH DIET ARE DETAILED, ESPECIALLY THE CONSUMPTION OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT CONTAIN COMPOUNDS FOUND IN TOMATOES, SUCH AS LYCOPENE. THIS REVIEW ALSO DISCUSSES HOW THE CULTIVATION OF TOMATO PLANTS CAN AFFECT THE NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF THE FRUIT HARVESTED. DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL GROWING CONDITIONS SUCH AS LIGHT INTENSITY, GROWING MEDIA, AND TEMPERATURE ARE EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT THEY HAVE ON THE QUALITY OF FRUIT, ITS NUTRIENT CONTENT, AND HENCE THE POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS ACQUIRED FROM EATING THE FRUIT. THIS REVIEW OUTLINES THE HEALTH BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULAR CONSUMPTION OF TOMATOES AND TOMATO PRODUCTS. THE FIRST SECTION PROVIDES A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE HORTICULTURAL TECHNIQUES THAT CAN IMPACT THE QUALITY OF THE FRUIT AND ITS NUTRITIONAL PROPERTIES, INCLUDING WATER AVAILABILITY, LIGHT INTENSITY, TEMPERATURE, AND GROWING MEDIA. THE NEXT SECTION PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE COMPONENTS OF TOMATO THAT ARE LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO ITS HEALTH EFFECTS. THE REVIEW THEN DETAILS SOME OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH TOMATO CONSUMPTION, INCLUDING ANTICANCER PROPERTIES, CARDIOVASCULAR AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES AND SKIN HEALTH. THIS REVIEW ALSO DISCUSSES THE IMPACT TOMATOES CAN HAVE ON THE GUT MICROBIOME AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH BENEFITS, INCLUDING REDUCING THE RISK OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES. OTHER HEALTH BENEFITS OF EATING TOMATOES ARE ALSO DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO EFFECTS ON DIABETES, THE IMMUNE RESPONSE, EXERCISE RECOVERY, AND FERTILITY. FINALLY, THIS REVIEW ALSO ADDRESSES THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT CAN OCCUR AS A RESULT OF OVERCONSUMPTION OF TOMATO PRODUCTS AND LYCOPENE SUPPLEMENTS."
